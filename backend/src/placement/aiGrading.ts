// Rubric-based grading for everything that has no single machine-checkable
// correct answer, using Gemini. Every one of these types is graded from
// TEXT — for spoken types, that's the transcript the browser's own
// SpeechRecognition produced (or whatever the learner typed as a fallback).
//
// This used to run on Claude, which has no audio input at all. Migrated to
// Gemini because Gemini can accept both text and audio under one API key —
// but this function still only ever sends it TEXT, on purpose: Gemini's own
// audio-quality judgment (see geminiFluency.ts) was tested directly and
// found to hallucinate on real recordings, so content correctness is kept
// on the same solid ground as before (text only) rather than trusting an
// audio judgment call here too. Gemini's text-only grading was tested
// separately — repeated identical trials came back consistent, unlike its
// audio judgment — see Grading_Methods_Report.md.
//
// Fails closed: any missing key, network error, or unparseable response
// returns null, and the caller treats that exactly like "no verdict yet."
// A grading outage should never crash an attempt submission or silently
// mark someone wrong.
