-- Seed content for the placement test's 10 item types (6 spoken, from the
-- Versant English Test; 4 typed, from the Versant Writing Test). 2 items per
-- type, hand-authored as a starter set. All items land as status='draft' —
-- per the items table's intended workflow, a reviewer still needs to approve
-- each one (set review_decision + reviewer_id) before it's usable in a real
-- session. The 6 mic-based types need real audio recorded/generated for
-- item_audio before they're actually playable; this only seeds the text.
-- Re-runnable: safe to run against any environment via
--   psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f seeds/001_placement_items.sql
